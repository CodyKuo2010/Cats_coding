## The Algorithm

Add an explanation of the algorithm and how it works. Make sure to include details about how the code works, what it depends on, and any other relevant info. Add images or other descriptions for your project here. 

## Running this project

1. Make sure that you have a sufficient amount of pictures per pet. You will need a lot of them. Make directories under my_pets which is in jetson_inference -> python -> training -> classification -> data.
2. Make 3 directories per pet, one under val, one under train, one under test. Upload images to each directory(you can use the same pictures for each directory, though different pictures are better).
3. Find the my_pets 
4. Make sure to include any required libraries that need to be installed for your project to run.
